# Digital Clinical Safety Platform (DCSP)
A web based app for building out markdown files for the documentation of clinical safety hazard logs DCB0129 and DCB0160.

Other documentation templates can be uploaded

# The build
- Python based backend
- Some javascript in the front end
- Django for the dynamic site. This is used to build up and edit the static site
- Materials for MkDocs for the static site (where the clinical safety documentation is stored.)

Many thanks are due for Marcus Baw for his work on his [cookiecutter-DCB0129 code](https://github.com/digital-clinical-safety-alliance/dcb0129-mkdocs-template). Many, if not all of the ideas within this program have been used to create DCSP.
