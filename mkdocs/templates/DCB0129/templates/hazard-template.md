### Name
A short name

### Description
A general description of the Hazard. Keep it short. Detail goes below.

### Cause(s)
The upstream system Cause (can be multiple - use a numbered list) that results in the change to intended care.

### Effect
The change in the intended care pathway resulting from the Cause.

### Hazard
The *potential* for Harm to occur, even if it does not.

### Harm
An actual occurrence of a Hazard in the patient or clinical context. This is what we are assessing the **Severity** and **Likelihood** of. This is form normal working conditions and fault conditions. Include the ultimate **Risk rating** as well.

### Existing controls
List any pre-existing controls that can mitigate the hazard.

-----

**Assignment**: Assign this Hazard to its Owner. Default owner is the Clinical Safety Officer [ a person ]

**Labelling**: Add labels according to Severity. Likelihood and Risk Level

**Project**: Add to the Project 'Clinical Risk Management'

* Subsequent discussion can be used to mitigate the Hazard, reducing the likelihood (or less commonly reducing the severity) of the Harm.
* If Harm is reduced then you can change the labels to reflect this and reclassify the Risk Score.
* Issues can be linked to: Issues describing specific software changes, Pull Requests or Commits fixing Issues, external links, and much more supporting documentation. Aim for a comprehensive, well-evidenced, public and open discussion on risk and safety.

### New hazard controls
List controls that will be put into place to mitigate the hazard. These can include design, (unit/integration) testing, training or business process change.

### Residual Hazard Risk Assessment
Include a repeat analysis of **Severity** and **Likelihood**. Include the ultimate **Risk rating** as well.

### Hazard Status
Either 'open', 'transferred' or 'closed'.
